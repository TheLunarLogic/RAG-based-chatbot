## Setup

### 1. Create conda environment

```bash
conda create -n rag python=3.11 -y
conda activate rag
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
```

- Get a Groq API key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
- Get a Deepgram API key at [console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com)

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF** — Use the sidebar file uploader.
2. **Ask questions** — Type in the chat input or click 🎤 Speak.
3. **Switch threads** — Click past conversations in the sidebar to resume.
4. **New chat** — Click "New Chat" to start a fresh thread with a new document.

## Notes

- Voice recording uses `sounddevice` which records from the **local machine's microphone**. This works when running Streamlit on localhost.
- The `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` is optional — text chat works without it, only voice features require it.
- Conversation history is persisted in `chatbot.db` (SQLite). Delete this file to reset all threads.
